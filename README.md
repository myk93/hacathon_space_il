# hacathon_space_il
Description: This project uses the KMeans clustering algorithm to cluster points of interest in images from the Bereshit spaceship. The model is trained on a dataset of images from the Bereshit mission, and can be used to predict points of interest in future images from the Bereshit 2 mission.

## Libraries:

*`scipy`
*`numpy`
*`matplotlib`
*`sklearn`
*`Usage:`

## Installation
### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/myk93/hacathon_space_il.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd hacathon_space_il
```

### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


This will train the KMeans model and cluster the points of interest in the images.
## TO-DO
* Improve the performance of the KMeans model.
* Add more features to the images, such as color and texture.
* Use the model to predict points of interest in future images from the Bereshit 2 mission.
